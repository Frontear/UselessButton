# UselessButton
An initial python project where the objective is to continuously press a red button with absolutely no visible reward. Developed and written in [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Getting Started
We encourage using a Python [virtual environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments), and using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and maintaining this project.

- Clone this repository via `git clone https://github.com/Frontear/UselessButton.git UselessButton`
- Create a virtual environment in the repo via `cd UselessButton && python -m venv .venv`
- Open the workspace folder **UselessButton** in VS Code. It should automatically setup the virtual environment
- Execute `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies
